            To access this part of the application, select the payments menu, and then Payment Batches.
            You should see a window similar to the following:
        </p>
        <img src="batch-start.png">

        <p>
            The first step is to click the new button, and a new batch will be created.
        </p>
        <img src="batch-start1.png">

        <p>
            In this case, we have a batch id of DT20150828001.
            This id created models the batch numbers provided by the bank check scanning
            software system. You can change the ID and/or the Deposit Date if required.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step is to add documents(checks) to this batch. You will do this by either double clicking
            the batch listed in the left side grid, or selecting the batch, and
            clicking the Documents button.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you enter the documents for a batch, you will be presented with a list
            of pending(unselected) payments similar to the following.
        </p>
        <img src="documents.png">

        <p>
            At this point, you should select payments on left side, click and drag
            to the right side. This drag & drop activity will select the payment(s)
            for this specific batch. You may notice the totals on the bottom of the
            window will update as you drag & drop payments.
        </p>
        <img src="documents-after.png">

        <p>
            There may be cases where you need to modify the amount of a payment. The system
            will allow a change to the amount only if it has not been associated with a
            payment batch. You can only change the amount if it is considered a pending payment.
            Here is an example of a payment change from $0.00 to $10.00.
        </p>

        <p>The user selected a payment that was created with $0.00, and we need to change to $10.00.</p>

        <p>
            The steps required for changing the amount:
        <ul>
            <li>Find the payment on left side and select.</li>
            <li>Click the Edit Amount button.</li>
            <li>Change the amount</li>
            <li>Click the Save button.</li>
            <li>If this payment had already been posted to A/R,
                then a message will be displayed instructing you
                to contact the A/R department.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>User edits amount.</p>
        <img src="documents-edit2.png">

        <p>Amount has been changed, and user selected this payment for the batch.</p>

        </p>

        <p>
            The last step in this process is to post the batch.  You should have a batch total available
            from the bank scanning software.  The document count & amount for the bank batch and
            this software should match.  If they don't match, you will need to determine what is
            different, and resolve the issues.<br>
            Once the two sources match, you will simply click the post button.
