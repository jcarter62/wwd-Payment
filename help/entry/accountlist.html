    <h1>Payment Entry, Account Entry</h1>

    <p>
        The user has two options to specify the Account for proper payment application.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Simply Type Account: If the user knows the exact
            account number, they can simply type the account.
            As the user's cursor leaves this field, the system
            will attempt to lookup the account name. If found, then the account name
            will fill the Name field.
        </li>
        <li>Double Click the Account Text Box: The user will be presented with
            a lookup window.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is an example payment entry</p>

    <p>When the user double clicks the Account field, they will be presented
        with another window like the following</p>
    <img src="../images/payment/lookup1.png">

    <p>The user enters a search term in the upper left area, and the system
        will populate the list of accounts that match the term. In this case the
        user was searching for the term "jacki", and the system found 3 accounts.</p>

    <p>Here is another example where the user searched for "140".</p>

    <p>After the user clicks or selects one of the accounts, the system will attempt
        to find any outstanding charges for the selected account. In this case
        the system found some outstanding/unpaid charges.</p>
